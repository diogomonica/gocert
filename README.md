gocert
======

A small go program to print details on X509 certificates and safe them in .pem format.

# Why?

- Because I can never remember openssl's syntax. The s_client -connect is not intuitive. 
- Because I want a better way for displaying certificates, with emphasis on what matters.
- Because I want to be able to extract remote certificates .pem's easily
